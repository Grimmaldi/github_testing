A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A stitch in time preserves nine.
If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
Many a mickle makes a muckle.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a step.
You are what you eat.
A watched pot never boils.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
